## Short biased bio
I am researcher with a Physics background. I earned my Physics BSc (Licenciatura de Física) at the
Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain. At the time I loved studying General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics (who not?)
but by the end of the degree, luckily enough, I was introduced into territory beyond conventional physics, i.e.
physicis applied to society, the economy, biology, and the like. Thus, I decided to gain some specialization on this
with the hope of starting a PhD on complex systems. I failed to this last thing, but at least I've got a master
degree specialized on the Physics of Complex Systems from UNED (Universidad Española de Educación a Distancia).
Years later, after some wandering, earning another MSc, now to become a high school teacher, and getting a training
internship for 2 years at AEMET (Spanish Meteorological Agency) I finally achieved an pre-doctoral position
back at home, at Zaragoza's BIFI (Institute of Biophysics and Complex Systems). I earned my PhD in March 2024, by
specializing on computational epidemics.

## Research focus & interests
My Ph.D. research has been focused on epidemic spreading modeling through the application of concepts and tools from
complex system theory (complex networks, nonlinear dynamics, ABMs, and so on). We care about both the theoretical
side and the application side.

Apart from that, I have a strong interest in approaching economic phenomena from the point of view of complexity
economics and biophysical economics. Overall, I love learning about complex phenomena related to human societies and
also sustainability issues.
